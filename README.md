![Profile Views](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/veelwater)

I'm a seasoned Software Engineer with a passion for Machine Learning and a knack for turning coffee into code. I've been in the tech industry for over a decade, and I've worn many hats - from a junior developer to a senior software engineer, and everything in between. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

## 👀 Interests

I'm deeply interested in the intersection of technology and society, and how Machine Learning can be used to solve real-world problems. I'm also a big fan of open-source software and love contributing to projects that pique my interest. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or buried in a good book.

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate

I'm always looking to collaborate on interesting projects, especially those that can make a positive impact on society. If you're working on something that could use my skills, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm particularly interested in projects related to Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Development.
